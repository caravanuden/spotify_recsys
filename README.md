Spotify is an online music streaming service with over 140 million active users and over 30 million tracks. One of its popular features is the ability to create playlists, and the service currently hosts over 2 billion playlists.

This year's challenge focuses on music recommendation, specifically the challenge of automatic playlist continuation. By suggesting appropriate songs to add to a playlist, a recommender system can increase user engagement by making playlist creation easier, as well as extending listening beyond the end of existing playlists. The goal of the challenge is to develop a system for the task of automatic playlist continuation. Given a set of playlist features, participants’ systems shall generate a list of recommended tracks that can be added to that playlist, thereby ‘continuing’ the playlist.

As part of this challenge, Spotify has released the Million Playlist Dataset. The MPD contains a million user-generated playlists that were created during the period of January 2010 through October 2017. Each playlist in the MPD contains a playlist title, the track list (including track metadata such as artist, album, and track duration) editing information (last edit time, number of playlist edits) and other miscellaneous information about the playlist.
